Developed by a seven-person team for Westermo Network Technologies AB, AnomDet is a modular system built to detect and visualize real-time performance anomalies in the data from industrial test servers. This software provides a critical capability for Westermo by enabling the evaluation of different anomaly detection algorithms against their datasets, supported by synthetic anomaly injection for robust testing.
